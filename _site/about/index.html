  <p>The best engineering happens when developers can stay in flow state, but most get bogged down by process overhead, tool friction, and endless context switching that fragments focus and kills velocity. I've watched this pattern destroy productivity across every team I've worked with.</p>
<p><img src="/img/me.jpg" alt="Thomas Strömberg"></p>
<p>During my time at Google and Chainguard, I built tools like <strong>Triage Party</strong> and <strong>malcontent</strong> that started from &quot;this should be easier&quot; moments. But the breakthrough came when I realized the real bottleneck wasn't technical complexity—it was human. Talented developers were burning out not from hard problems, but from collaborative friction in modern software development.</p>
<p>That realization led me to found <strong>codeGROOVE</strong>, where we're building tools that respect developer craftsmanship instead of fighting against it. On a long enough timescale, open-source always wins, which is why we're focused on making the collaborative aspects of software development fundamentally better.</p>
<p>This systems thinking approach works everywhere. Whether I'm carving custom bamboo bicycle frames (spoiler: you probably shouldn't), exploring North Carolina backroads on my electric motorcycle, or debugging complex distributed systems, it's all about understanding how things work, taking them apart, and reassembling them for the better.</p>
<p>I'm based in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog who are all surprisingly patient with my tendency to overthink simple problems. This site documents the journey—both the wins and the spectacular failures.</p>
