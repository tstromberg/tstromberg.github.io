  <h1>My yearly rebirth</h1>
  <div class="post-meta">
    <p>Published on January 2, 2023</p>
  </div>
  <p>For years I’ve had New Year’s resolutions to commit to blogging. This year isn’t any different!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/sCmY18H9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, what is different? For one, I feel I have more to share with the world now. I recently moved back to North Carolina, took up motorcycling again, and have professionally refocused on computer security.</p>
<p>In a surprising turn of events, Twitter recently torched its community goodwill and has suffered a massive brain drain. While this has been felt most acutely in the computer security industry, other groups, such as journalists, have also moved to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>. I’ve tried my hand at Mastodon too, and while it’s been a good way to connect with more local personalities, it still feels a bit empty and hollow.</p>
<p>The post-Twitter shift has made room for a nascent renaissance in distributed social media and even blogging. There's been a clamor for folks to <a href="https://startafuckingblog.com/">Start a Fucking Blog</a>. Feeds are back en vogue, even if they have taken on a new flavor: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>.</p>
<p>Now blogs such as this one have ActivityPub feeds, which means they can be followed on Mastodon (this one is <code>@thomrstrom@unfinished.bike</code>). Even a decade after it was declared dead, RSS is still around and <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> is as good as ever.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will be done with this next-to-new-found-land.</p>
