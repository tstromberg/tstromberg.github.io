<p>Some of you may have heard that there was <a href="https://github.com/LottieFiles/lottie-player/issues/254">another supply-chain attack against an open-source project yesterday</a> - this time in a Javascript library called <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/web-player">Lottie Web Player.</a></p>
<p>I have yet to talk much about it, but earlier this year I started an open-source project named <a href="https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent">malcontent</a> that detects precisely this kind of attack: malicious changes in open-source software. This is very relevant to my day job at <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a>.</p>
<p>malcontent summarizes the risks and capabilities of a file and alerts when a new version substantially changes those risks and capabilities. It's easier to show you with a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/4ywoSN73.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In a nutshell:  <code>mal diff</code> calculated that the risk of file went from MEDIUM to CRITICAL between two revisions. In doing so, it surfaced a number of new behaviors that would catch the eye of a code reviewer. The idea here is that no tool will be able to give you a 100% reliable answer to “Is it malicious or not?” but as a code reviewer, you have the context of what functionality changes are reasonable to you for the library you are consuming.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent">malcontent</a> works on any file you might encounter in open source, from shell scripts to Linux ELF binaries to macOS machO binaries and PHP. While we’ve incorporated over 15,000 <a href="https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">YARA rules</a>, we're far from the same quality level as VirusTotal; so if you are handy in YARA or <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> or would like to learn more about them, PRs are welcome!</p>
<p>PS - malcontent can also be used as a basic malware scanner - but it isn’t yet as impressive as the “diff” mode:  <code>mal scan /path</code></p>
