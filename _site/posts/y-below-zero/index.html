<p>TL;DR: If you think outside of the box, you can sleep 4 with full climate control for a cost of 10-12% battery usage per night, even in freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>When we bought our Tesla Model Y in December, the intent was to roughly recreate the experiences of our trusty 1971 VW Bus, but in electric form.</p>
<p>With all the cargo space, and the availability of great mattress options, such as the Tesmat, one can get pretty close to a passenger-van conversion. What one cannot simulate easily however, is the 4-person sleeping experience one can get from a  pop-up tent. The Tesla Model Y can only comfortably fit 2 adults, or 1 adult &amp; two children.</p>
<p>The best option I've found for sleeping 4 is the <a href="https://www.napieroutdoors.com/shop/suv-minivan-tents/sportz-suv-tent-model-82000/.">Napier SUV Sportz Tent</a> This gargantuan tent attaches easily to the back of a Tesla Model Y, but it is a bit heavy and bulky to pack up. The biggest plus side to this option is that you can still run the Camp Mode on the Tesla Model Y to heat the tent: which is something we tested this weekend.</p>

<p>Using Camp Mode to climate control the Napier tent is a party trick that is mostly only useful in extreme temperatures. In my experience, Camp Mode on the Tesla Model Y consumes ~10% battery life when set to 67'F with a 40'F exterior temperature, and the trunk closed.</p>
<p>My primary concern was power consumption due to the lack of insulation: tents are typically nowhere near as insulated as a Tesla. How much power would we waste by adding the tent?</p>
<p>To counter the insulation issue, I ordered 3mm 48&quot;x50Ft, and a single roll of foil tape, to build a ~5'x5'x5' cube within the Napier SUV Tent, lovingly called the &quot;space station&quot;:</p>

<p>The foil tape ran out quite quickly, so I finished it up with some painters tape.</p>
<p>On the first night of testing, we arrived at 10pm with 68% battery, raining cats &amp; dogs, and a chilly 35'F. I was too busy trying to setup without getting soaked that I didn't bother sealing the gaps too much.</p>
<p>I set the Tesla to Camp Mode @ 67'F, and used a screwdriver to flip the trunk latch to trick the car into thinking the trunk was shut. I had heard that otherwise, the climate control  would shut off after 30 minutes. Our battery went from 67% to 47%: a 20% drop over 10 hours, which had me a bit worried for the second night.</p>

<p>By this point, we had acquired 2 extra rolls of foil tape (still not enough), and used some duct-tape to seal the gaps between the car and the space station. I was more conservative this time, setting the car to 60'F, setting the vent manually to 1. After 7 hours, we consumed only 5% battery, so I increased the heat to 66'F for the next 4 hours, which consumed another 5%. Not bad when the exterior temperature was 30'F!</p>
<p>One recommendation is a stuff sack, as packing the inner tent can consume a lot of space in the car otherwise (a little bit bigger than the packed size of the Napier SUV tent). Here's a photo of the inner tent  before I rolled it up:</p>

<p>When we left the campsite, we were at 33% battery, which was just enough to get us to the supercharger in Ukiah. My backup plan was a slow charger just up the road in Lakeport, which I still tried for fun.</p>

<p>This experiment means that the insulated Napier tent is effectively as efficient insulation wise as the Tesla itself: at worst, 10-20% more power consumption over the regular Camp Mode with the trunk shut. Depending on your target temperature, plan on 10-12% battery consumption per night (11 hours) with Camp Mode in the Tesla Model Y.</p>

<p>This result means that the Tesla Y can sleep 4 people in freezing temperatures for multiple nights in a row without a source of electricity. I still have a few gaps to fill with foil tape, and need to bring painters tape on the next trip to quickly seal it against the car.</p>
<p>Hope this post helps someone!</p>
