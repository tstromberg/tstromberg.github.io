<p>Today I packed up the <a href="https://www.bmwmotorcycles.com/en/models/urban_mobility/ce04.html">BMW CE-04</a> and did a range test to see how far I could get on North Carolina rural highways with everything: 62 miles, just as expected. What I packed is a bit different than what I would have packed had I been doing a ride on my GS's of yore:</p>

<p>Here's what I've packed:</p>
<p>- Emergency charging gear: J1772 cable, Jackery 1000 Power bank, adapters (TT30, 30A, 50A, Tesla), charger for Jackery
- Clothes: 2 shirts, 3 socks (1 waterproof), rain jacket, rain pants
- Tools: MotoPumps AirShot, Dynaplug Xtreme, Allen key set, Torx set, Headlamp, multi-tool
- Self-care: water bottle, snacks, toothbrush, deodorant, eye mask, first-aid kit, Garmin Messenger (Satellite tracker)
- Entertainment: MacBook Air, Fuji X100V, Kindle, USB cables</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this all fits without needing to bring along an ugly top case:</p>

I did take the test ride as an opportunity to test the &quot;Electric Jerry Can&quot;, and it ran fine at 10A. This is my homemade range extender for EVs, built out of a Jackery 1000 battery bank with a ground-free EVSE cable. Itâ€™s good for an extra 9% of range should I run into a disabled charger or make a terrible miscalculation:</p>
