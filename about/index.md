title: About Thomas Strömberg
---

At my core, I'm a craftsman. My medium is technology, but my philosophy is simple: understand how a system works, and then help make it better—more resilient, more useful, and more open for others to build upon.

This has been the common thread through my career, from building open-source tools like `minikube` and `Triage Party` to working on large-scale infrastructure at Google and Chainguard. The goal has always been to build things that empower people, and to do it in a way that fosters a sense of shared ownership and pride. Now, I'm pouring that same energy into my startup, `codeHAPPY`, where we're focused on improving the developer experience by treating code as a craft.

This mindset follows me home. The same focus on craftsmanship that I apply to software, I also bring to my garage, where I've spent absurd hours hand-carving bamboo bicycle frames. The same love for the journey takes me out on the backroads of North Carolina on an electric motorcycle. It’s all part of the same adventure. I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog, who are all surprisingly patient with my shenanigans. This site is where I document it all.
