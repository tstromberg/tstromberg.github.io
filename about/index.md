title: About Thomas Strömberg
---

I've always been the kind of person who likes to take things apart to see how they work. Sometimes that means building a bamboo bicycle from scratch, and other times it's poking around in the internals of a complex piece of software. It's all about curiosity and a desire to make things better.

After years of working as a software engineer at places like Google and Chainguard, I saw a frustrating pattern. The most talented developers I knew were getting bogged down by endless meetings, clunky tools, and the constant churn of modern software development. It wasn't the hard technical problems that were burning people out; it was the friction of working together.

I've always been a builder. I created tools like **Triage Party**, **malcontent**, and **iExploder** to scratch my own itches. But I realized that the real problem wasn't something I could solve with a script: the real problem was collaboration.

That's why I started **codeGROOVE**. We're building tools that get out of the way and let developers do what they do best: build great software. I'm a huge believer in open-source, and we're committed to making both open-source & commercial software development a more joyful and collaborative experience.

I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog. They're all incredibly patient with me, especially when I'm overthinking something simple. This website is where I document my adventures in tinkering, both the successes and the spectacular failures.
