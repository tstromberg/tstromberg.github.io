  <h1>The anatomy of a great playbook entry</h1>

<p>What if you could easily reduce the length of outages by 3X?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/">SRE book</a>, &quot;recording the best practices ahead of time in a playbook produces roughly a 3x improvement in MTTR&quot;.  This improvement mirrors my experience with well-written playbooks.</p>
<p>So what makes a playbook entry &quot;great&quot;?</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Remember how you felt in your first on-call rotation, when you were paged at 3am for a system you barely understood? <strong>Write your playbook entries for that person.</strong></p>
<p>Playbooks should provide just enough context to confidently work through an incident, without providing extraneous content that will be a burden to keep up-to-date.</p>
<p>Be wary of playbooks that offer exact remediation steps: these are often a sign of sacrificing human blood to a system that should be automated.</p>
<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Alerts should always include the relevant playbook URL. Otherwise, you will introduce human error by introducing the possibility of the responder following the incorrect playbook.</p>
<p>Consider including the alert name in the playbook URL to make it easier to find. This also the alert template to be templatized in some systems. For example: <code>https://playbooks/%%ALERT_NAME%%</code></p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Playbooks are the easiest to scan through in an emergency when they have a consistent structure. The exact best structure may differ depending on the organization, but this is what has worked for me:</p>
<p>The structure that works best is highly dependent on your team's culture, but this is what has worked for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity</strong>: How to assess the criticality of this alert from your team's point of view. Is it a slow-burning issue that generates tickets, a critical paging event, or does the severity depend on the duration?</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: How are your customers impacted by this alert? Often a one-liner, for example: &quot;None immediately. If ignored, may result in revenue-impacting customer provisioning failures due to resource exhaustion&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong>: 1-2 graphs showing the impact, duration, and if the effect is worsening. Inline live-updating graphs work best, as they can prevent the incident responder from making unnecessary changes when the problem is dissipating. Hyperlinks are nearly as good.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: What should a new person on the on-call rotation know about this system? Be terse, providing a hyperlink for more information and/or an architectural diagram. To reduce maintenance burden and cognitive load during incident response, share this section between multiple playbook entries via templating.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation</strong>: What are the recommended steps to mitigate the issue? This is often in checklist-style and may include steps for rolling back or redirecting traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong>: How should one get started digging into why this alert is firing? For example:
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check for recent fatal error messages:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the cluster for free disk space:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check url to see when the last release went out</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>References</strong>: Links to the alert configuration, or code that generates the metric used by the alert, can be useful in understanding the underlying behavior. Post-mortems can also be valuable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formatting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be concise</li>
<li>Bulleted or numbered lists instead of paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/">Kubernetes Documentation Style Guide</a>  has great recommendations for technical documentation, but the most important for playbooks is: <strong>make your commands trivial to copy and paste.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include the command prompt. S
<ul>
<li>See: <a href="https://tanelpoder.com/posts/how-to-stay-safe-in-shell/">data loss due to &gt; character in prompt</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separate commands from example output</li>
<li>Do not include real but unrelated host, site, or cluster names in your example command.
<ul>
<li>I once saw an outage spread when a responder copied an example command with the intent to edit the hostnames before pressing enter. They pressed enter first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Keep playbooks up to date by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly scheduled <a href="%5Bhttps://sre.google/sre-book/accelerating-sre-on-call/">&quot;Wheel of Misfortune&quot; role-playing game sessions</a>, where the previous on-call engineer walks the current on-call engineer through a pager response scenario.</li>
<li>Post-mortem action items that suggest playbook updates to decrease the resolution time for future pages for the same alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big-bang efforts such as auditing all of the playbooks for relevance are best made once initially, to get the playbooks into the same structure. I have never seen quarterly playbook reviews work.</p>
