title: About Thomas Strömberg

I solve problems by understanding how systems work, then making them better. My medium is usually software, but the approach is the same whether I'm debugging a Kubernetes cluster or hand-carving a bamboo bicycle frame.

On a long enough timescale, open-source always wins. I've spent most of my career building tools that help other people build things: **minikube** to make Kubernetes accessible to everyone, **malcontent** to catch supply-chain attacks before they hit production, and dozens of other projects that started as "this should be easier" moments.

These days I'm busy as the **Founder and CEO at codeGROOVE**, where we're trying to make the developer experience less miserable by treating code as a craft rather than a commodity. Before this, I spent time at Google (Kubernetes, Cluster Automation) and Chainguard (supply-chain security), always focused on the same thing: building systems that empower people while staying resilient against the creative ways things break.

The same problem-solving approach follows me home. I've burned ridiculous hours carving custom bike frames (spoiler: you probably shouldn't), exploring North Carolina backroads on an electric motorcycle, and generally treating life as one big debugging session. I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog who are all surprisingly patient with my tendency to overthink simple problems. This site is where I document the journey—both the wins and the spectacular failures.
