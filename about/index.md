title: About Thomas Strömberg

I solve problems by understanding how complex systems work, taking them apart, and reassembling them for the better. My medium is usually software, but the approach is the same whether I'm debugging a failing kernel module or a home-made bamboo bicycle frame.

On a long enough timescale, open-source always wins. I've spent most of my career building tools that help other people build things: **minikube** to make Kubernetes accessible to everyone, **malcontent** to catch supply-chain attacks before they hit production, and dozens of other projects that started as "this should be easier" moments.

During my time at Google (Kubernetes, Cluster Automation) and later Chainguard (supply-chain security), I learned that building scalable systems is only half the challenge. The harder part is understanding how engineers think, what motivates them, and what burns them out. I watched talented developers get bogged down not by technical complexity, but by process overhead, tool friction, and the endless context switching that fragments focus and kills velocity.

That's why I'm now **Founder and CEO at codeGROOVE**, where we're focused on improving developer velocity and making the collaborative aspects of modern software development suck less. The best engineering happens when people can stay in flow state, empowered by tools that respect their craftsmanship rather than fighting against it.

The same problem-solving approach follows me home. I've burned ridiculous hours carving custom bike frames (spoiler: you probably shouldn't), exploring North Carolina backroads on an electric motorcycle, and generally treating life as one big debugging session. I live in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog who are all surprisingly patient with my tendency to overthink simple problems. This site is where I document the journey—both the wins and the spectacular failures.
