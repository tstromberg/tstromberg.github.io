For years I’ve had New Year’s resolutions to commit to blogging. This year isn’t any different!

So, what is different? For one, I feel I have more to share with the world now. I recently moved back to North Carolina, took up motorcycling again, and have professionally refocused on computer security.

In a surprising turn of events, Twitter recently torched its community goodwill and has suffered a massive brain drain. While this has been felt most acutely in the computer security industry, other groups, such as journalists, have also moved to [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/ "Mastodon"). I’ve tried my hand at Mastodon too, and while it’s been a good way to connect with more local personalities, it still feels a bit empty and hollow.

The post-Twitter shift has made room for a nascent renaissance in distributed social media and even blogging. There's been a clamor for folks to [Start a Fucking Blog](https://startafuckingblog.com/). Feeds are back en vogue, even if they have taken on a new flavor: [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). 

Now blogs such as this one have ActivityPub feeds, which means they can be followed on Mastodon (this one is `@thomrstrom@unfinished.bike`). Even a decade after it was declared dead, RSS is still around and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is as good as ever.

It remains to be seen what will be done with this next-to-new-found-land.
