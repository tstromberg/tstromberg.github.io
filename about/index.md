title: About Thomas Strömberg

I'm drawn to understanding how things work, taking them apart, and reassembling them for the better. Whether I'm carving custom bamboo bicycle frames (spoiler: you probably shouldn't), exploring North Carolina backroads on my electric motorcycle, or debugging complex distributed systems—it's all systems thinking.

When I applied this lens to software development, I noticed something broken: the best engineering happens when developers can stay in flow state, but most get bogged down by process overhead, tool friction, and endless context switching. I'd watched this pattern destroy productivity across every team I'd worked with at Google and Chainguard.

The tools I built like **Triage Party** and **malcontent** started from "this should be easier" moments. But the real breakthrough came when I realized the bottleneck wasn't technical complexity—it was human. Talented developers were burning out not from hard problems, but from collaborative friction in modern software development.

That insight led me to found **codeGROOVE**, where we're building tools that respect developer craftsmanship instead of fighting against it. On a long enough timescale, open-source always wins, which is why we're focused on making the collaborative aspects of open-source software development better.

I'm based in Chapel Hill with my wife, two kids, and a dog who are all surprisingly patient with my tendency to overthink simple problems. This site documents the journey—both the wins and the spectacular failures.
